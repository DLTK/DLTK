motivation: The presidential executive order on cybersecurity, May-2021, requires all software sold to the government to show a traceable chain of custody (like car title) of it's origin. This pr includes a simple hash (sha256) that resides on a blockchain node (filecoin) at the address given. You simply compare the decrypted digital-copyright.enc file with the private key stored on your blockchain node for authenticity. This persists across platforms (not just github).
